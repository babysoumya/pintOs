			   ARGUMENT PASSING

No changes to struct were declared for argument passing. We changed
the function declaration of static bool setup_stack and bool load to

static bool setup_stack (void **esp, char **saveptr, const char *filename) 

bool load (const char *file_name, void (**eip) (void), void **esp, char **saveptr)

The functions were redefined because in start_process, strtok_r placed a NULL pointer at the
 first space in the command line. This separates the file name from the arguments. The save 
pointer (saveptr) is a pointer to the start of the arguments, which is used in setup_stack.

Argument parsing is implemented in the setup_stack function. The algorithm to handle parsing of 
the arguments is as follow:
  1) Creating two local variable char **cont and char **argv with a default size of 2.

  2) Parse the command line with strtok_r starting at save pointer. A pointer is kept to each 
  argument in char **cont throughout the parsing process. Since the number of arguments is 
  undefined, we will double the size of both cont and argv if we run out of space.

  3) Whenever entire command line is parsed, we will copy cont to argv in reverse order (end to
   start). This is because we have to push onto the stack in reverse order. While copying over to
   argv we push each character string onto the stack as well.

  4) By the end of the copying process, the argv will have all the arguments in reverse order. Then 
  we can word align (multiple of 4 bytes) the stack pointer. 

  5) Push the array of pointers from argv onto the stack. 

  6) Push the argv, argc and fake return address onto the stack.

  7) Free argv and cont

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

Pintos implement strtok_r() because in strtok() the point where the last
token was found is kept internally by the function to be use on the next
call to strtok(). The problem with this is that this will be prone to
race condition. Suppose two threads are calling strtok(), there is a possible
data race condition where one thread would use the last token held by another
thread. This would be incorrect and has potential to crash the kernel.

The kernel does not have to deal with parsing. Instead the shell will deal
with the parsing and error checking before passing the command line to the
kernel.

Added the following to struct thread:

    struct list file_list; 
    -  The file_list is use to keep track of files.
    
    int fd; 
    -  The fd is the current file descriptor.
      
    struct list child_list;
    -  The child_list is a list of the child processes of the thread.
    
    tid_t parent;
    -  The thread id of the parent of this thread.
      
    struct child_process* cp;
    -  This is pointer the current running child process.
      
     
    struct file* executable; 
    -  Use for denying writes to executables.
    
    struct list lock_list;
    -  Use to keep track of locks the thread holds.
      
Added the following struct in syscall.h:

struct child_process {
  int pid;
  int load_status;
  int wait;
  int exit;
  int status;
  struct semaphore load_sema;
  struct semaphore exit_sema;
  struct list_elem elem;
};

  The struct child_process is meant to be a child process which will hold
  important information such as the pid, load status and semaphores.

struct process_file {
    struct file *file;
    int fd;
    struct list_elem elem;
};
  The process_file holds the file you're currently working with. It contains
  the file descriptor and the content of the file.

struct lock file_system_lock;
  Use for locking critical section that involves modifying files.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

 The file descriptors are unique to each open file for every process. Each
  process has its only file descriptor counter, which will be incremented
  each time a file is opened. Therefore, the file descriptor is unique for each
  separate process.
